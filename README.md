Imagine you have a bunch of boxes, and each box has some stuff in it. Now, let's say you want to organize these boxes in a special way so you can quickly find things.

A binary tree in C is like a special way of arranging these boxes. Each box is called a "node," and each node has at most two other boxes connected to it. These connected boxes are called the "children" of the current box. The box at the top is called the "root."

Here's the rule: For each box (node), the stuff in the left box is smaller than the stuff in the right box. So, if you start at the root and follow these rules, you can quickly find any box with the stuff you're looking for.

Let me break it down:

1. **Root:** The top box where everything begins.
2. **Node:** A box in the tree.
3. **Child:** A box connected below another box.
4. **Left and Right:** The two directions a box can have children.

So, it's like a family tree, but instead of people, you have boxes, and each box has rules about where its smaller and larger stuff goes.

In C, you can use code to create and work with these tree structures. For example, you might have a code like this to define a node:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;  // This is the stuff in the box.
    struct Node* left;  // The box to the left.
    struct Node* right;  // The box to the right.
};
```

With a binary tree, you can do things like adding new boxes, finding boxes with specific stuff, and organizing your stuff in a way that makes it easy to find. It's like having a smart way to organize and search through your boxes of stuff!

# Task 0: Binary Tree Node Creation
============================================================

## Objective
The goal of this task is to create a function that generates a binary tree node. This function takes a pointer to the parent node and a value, and it returns a new node with the specified parent and value. The created node initially has no children.

## Function Signature
```c
binary_tree_t *binary_tree_node(binary_tree_t *parent, int value);
```

## Parameters
- `parent`: A pointer to the parent node of the node to be created.
- `value`: The value to be stored in the new node.

## Return Value
- A pointer to the newly created node.
- If memory allocation fails, the function returns `NULL`.

## Example Usage
```c
binary_tree_t *root;

root = binary_tree_node(NULL, 98);

root->left = binary_tree_node(root, 12);
root->left->left = binary_tree_node(root->left, 6);
root->left->right = binary_tree_node(root->left, 16);

root->right = binary_tree_node(root, 402);
root->right->left = binary_tree_node(root->right, 256);
root->right->right = binary_tree_node(root->right, 512);
```

## Explanation
This example demonstrates the creation of a binary tree using the `binary_tree_node` function. The `root` node is created with a value of 98, and child nodes are added with values 12, 6, 16, 402, 256, and 512. The resulting tree structure is printed for visualization.

## Notes
- The created node does not initially have any children.
- The function is designed to handle the dynamic allocation of memory for the new node and returns `NULL` on failure.
- The provided example showcases the usage of the function to construct a binary tree.
